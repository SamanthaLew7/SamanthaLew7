<h2 align="left">Hey there 👋!!! </h2>

###
Welcome to my little corner of GitHub 🗂️✨.  I'm Samantha, who's a Statistical Data Science graduate from Heriot-Watt University. I’m currently working on building a stronger portfolio to showcase my capabilities and to push myself to learn more along the way.

I love exploring new tech skills, especially in data and analytics 📊. I recently participated in the WiDS Datathon 2025, where I developed a predictive model utilising brain imaging and demographic data. This experience sparked my interest in leveraging data for real-world insights.

Here, you’ll mostly find:

- 🛠️ Projects I’m experimenting with
- 📚 Bits and pieces of what I’ve learned (and am still figuring out)
- 💡 Things that help me (and maybe you too) make sense of messy data and ideas

If you’re curious, feel free to look around. I'm still slowly uploading my personal projects. Always happy to connect, share ideas, or just swap tips on how to make learning fun (and a little less stressful) 🌟
